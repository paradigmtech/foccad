			<p>My ultimate goal is to open my own hair salon. I believes that mistakes made in past its part of discipline, eagerness to learn, and unwavering commitment are essential qualities for young people to pursue their dreams and aspirations. I am 23 years old a mother from Linga AGYW club and from Makuta village.</p>
<p>I was In form 3 when i got pregnant from my class mate, after that i dropped out from school and become hopeless with my life since I comes from a poor family where no one could support my needs.</p>
<p>In 2023 I was introduced to FOCCAD AGYW club by my friend and I joined and become one of hard working members as I was learning a lot from the club , I was being encouraged by fellow girls so that I should not lose hope.</p>
<p>Now I am one of AGYW girls being trained in Saloon. I want to start saving up by actively seeking my own clients and planning to buy a hair blow dryer. I would be immensely grateful for any additional support to help me fulfil my dream of opening my own business. Not only will it provide employment opportunities for me, but also for other youth who have undergone braiding training alongside me,” she expressed with sincere appreciation.</p>

			<p>Kamija a resident of Mpamantha village under Senior Chief Malengachanzi’s area in Nkhotakota district has, been a source of inspiration for hundreds of women in 47 Self Help Groups (SHGs) under FOCCAD in  the district by adapting three livelihood activities such as goat farming, Maize farming and rice farming business.</p>
<p>Her turning point came in 2020 after she joined Chimwemwe SHG following the introduction of the groups by FOCCAD and she started rice business by accessing loan of MWK30, 000 from her SHG group, 6 months after joining the group.</p>
<p style="font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;">“My interest gradually increased after starting rice business and I bought 3 bags of rice which I later sold each bag at MWK60, 000 and realized a MWK20, 000 profit which helped me to repay the loan and used the remaining money for another dairy needs”, she said.</p>
<p>According to Kamija, apart from doing rice business she also ventured into poultry farming where she bought 3 goats at MWK95,000 in 2022 and by now in 2023 she has 5 goats apart from purchasing about an acre piece of land where she plans to build houses as she is currently planting Maize for business.</p>
<p>She said: “I’m currently planning to renovate my house and after completion I will move from a grass thatched house to a descent house with iron sheets”.</p>

			<p>“Growing up in poverty, living in rural village, and attending schools with crumbling infrastructures, I got battle weary. I saw things no child should, and I became exhausted, learning of someone else in my community failing to achieve their goals and among friends who used to live close to me struggling with substance abuse”.Said Julius from liwewe village in Nkhotakota district T/A Malengachanzi.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; color: #565656;">Julius being the first born son in the family of 5 ,he always dreamt of becoming a change in the family he was determined, “but everything somehow always seemed a bit harder than I expected. As a village child, I thought if I behaved well and did my work, the path would pave itself for me. But in my younger years I had fears of poverty that created roadblocks such as not eating and other things.”said Julius.</p>

			<p>My name is Edwin , I am from Nkhwapu but staying here at Pendwe. I am 25 years old. I was forced to flee my village of origin as a result of being stubborn. I still have memories of the widespread life that I lived through before coming here. It was in 2021 when I moved here to stay with my parents after all this long have been raised with my uncle who stays at nkhwapu.</p>
<p>I used to be troublesome to the extent that i was chased from my uncle’s house . I eventually found myself in town (Nkhotakota boma) where I stayed for a week and then I went to my parents house. Once in my fathers house seeing how things were and how the family was suffering being the only son in the family with 5 sisters I was concerned with our financial status and I needed to change and start doing something productive than living life of smoking and drinking.</p>
<p>I was forced to start from scratch to work towards finding a gain a dignified and safe life despite the fact that i didn’t go further with my education. I drop out of school while in primary in standard 8. That is how I found myself being trained with FOCCAD  in mechanics specializing in motorbikes,I was introduced to this program through a friend who was attending such vocational training with Foccad but in different trade of welding and fabrication within our village. I was selected and I was able to benefit from trainings facilitated by FOCCAD. We were introduced to entrepreneurial skills, life skills e.t.c.</p>
<p>After acquiring such skills I submitted myself to this free training. I was using each opportunity to be close to my instructor and ask him questions where I see I am failing because my course needed attention despite that we were not writing formal exams because the main aim of this training was only for us to have skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>The opportunity started to flow on my way when we started receiving more customers at our training workshop. When we fixed more bikes our teacher could give us some cash a development that motivated us to probe more skills from our master artisan. I was saving money for myself to buy some spare parts so that I should be selling and now I am able to fix motorbikes on my own without any supervision. I manage to feed, care for my family members, and I enjoy good social standing in the community because of the skills that Foccad provided to me.</p>
