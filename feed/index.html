<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">August 30<sup>th</sup>, 2024 – The Foundation for Community and Capacity Development (FOCCAD), marked a significant milestone with the launch of its K408 million disbursement to 24 pilot villages in Nkhotakota district, under the Facilitated Collective Action Process (FCAP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">In collaboration with the Spark MicroGrants, the initiative aims to empower local communities from the 24 villages spread across four Traditional Authorities (T/As) of Kalimanjira, Mphonde, Mwadzama and Malengachanzi, to support their unique development projects, fostering community-led progress and collective action, each receiving a minimum of MK17 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">The launch event, held in Traditional Authority Kalimanjira, was attended by key stakeholders, including the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Digitalization, who is also former FOCCAD Board Chairperson, Mr. Baldwin Samuel Chiyamwaka as a Guest of Honour, Representatives from the District Council, Spark MicroGrants and Traditional Leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Mr. Chiyamwaka praised the initiative and urged the communities to maintain accountability in managing the funds, while acknowledging the vital support of Spark MicroGrants in making this initiative possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">FCAP model developed by Spark MicroGrants and FOCCAD, emphasizes community-led planning and decision-making and empowers local communities to identify their own priorities and invest in projects that will directly impact their livelihoods, such as irrigation farming, livestock production, maize milling, and the installation of piped water systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">FOCCAD Executive Director, Dan Nthara expressed confidence in the program’s ability to address the real issues affecting these communities, promoting sustainable economic growth and self-reliance. “The program is designed to empower communities to take charge of their own development, fostering resilience and self-sufficiency,” Nthara stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Both Traditional Authority (T/A) Kalimanjira and Dr. Jacob Kafulafula who represented the District’s Commissioner (DC), commended FOCCAD for the timely support, noting its importance in enhancing local economic development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">FOCCAD aligns the initiative with Malawi’s Vision 2063 Agenda, which focuses on human capital development and increasing local engagement in development activities. The disbursement of the funds will continue until the end of March 2025, reflecting FOCCAD’s commitment to sustainable community development and its dedication to fostering local capacities for improved livelihoods.</span></p>

<p>Meet Lina, a 13-year-old girl whose life has been transformed by FOCCAD&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Corner. Before joining the program, Lina struggled with her studies and often went to bed hungry. Her family, grappling with financial difficulties, couldn&#8217;t provide the support she needed to thrive.</p>
<p>Lina&#8217;s journey changed dramatically when she started attending the Children&#8217;s Corner. She quickly fell in love with the reading sessions, and with the help of patient and caring volunteers, she learned to read fluently within months. Her newfound literacy skills ignited a passion for learning, and she began excelling in all her subjects.</p>
<p>The nutritious meals provided by the program had a visible impact on Lina&#8217;s health and energy levels. She became more active and engaged, both in the classroom and on the playground. The psychosocial support offered at the Children&#8217;s Corner helped Lina build confidence and develop coping strategies for the challenges she faced at home.</p>
<p>Lina&#8217;s story is not unique. Every weekend, hundreds of children like her experience the transformative power of FOCCAD&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Corner. They leave the program not only with improved academic skills and better health but also with a sense of hope and possibility for their future.</p>

<p>I am Geofrey Saidi, a 27-year-old from Sasani. My journey has been a difficult one, marked by poverty and limited opportunities. Growing up in a family of eight siblings, we often went without basic necessities, such as sugar, for months. We slept on mats on the ground and found joy in our simple meals of nsima and dry fish. Despite these challenges, I had a dream of becoming a teacher, sparked by my talents in Chichewa and maths. In 2014, my family&#8217;s financial struggles forced me to abandon my dream.</p>
<p>I had to drop out of school in Standard 8, and for many years, I remained in the village, unable to pursue further education or training. I felt trapped by my circumstances, with no hope of escaping the cycle of poverty that had defined my life. In 2023, everything changed. I was introduced to a vocational training program offered by FOCCAD, supported by Tools for Self-Resilience.</p>

I embraced this opportunity with all my heart, gaining valuable knowledge and skills that empowered me to change my life. As a beneficiary of project, I received training that opened up new possibilities for me. I discovered a passion for creating and crafting, which brought me immense joy. The skills I acquired allowed me to start making products that not only showcased my abilities but also provided a means of livelihood.</p>
<p>The skills and knowledge I gained have given me confidence and a sense of purpose. This change matters deeply to me as it signifies a new chapter of self-reliance and hope. I attribute my success to the collaborative effort of FOCCAD and Tools for Self-Resilience. The partnership and the resources made available to me were crucial in my journey towards self-reliance. I have gone from a village boy with limited prospects to a skilled, confident young tailor in  my community.</p>

<p>In the remote Katimbira area of Nkhotakota, accessing health services has long been a challenge for residents. The nearest health center is 8 kilometers away, a distance that many, especially the elderly and Pregnant women ,struggle to cover. Recognizing this critical gap, FOCCAD initiated an outreach clinic to bring essential health services closer to the people, bridging the distance barrier and providing much-needed medical care.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the residents deeply affected by this initiative is Beatrice, a 72-year-old woman from a surrounding village. Beatrice, like many others in her community, struggled to access healthcare due to the prohibitive distance to the nearest clinic. The journey was not only lengthy but also fraught with challenges, especially for someone of her age. &#8220;It was very difficult for me to travel to the health center,&#8221; Beatrice explains. &#8220;I often had to make the journey on foot, which took a lot of time and left me exhausted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The situation was further complicated by the lack of reliable transportation. Beatrice often had to rely on the goodwill of neighbors for a ride or, when no help was available, endure the arduous walk. Additionally, upon reaching the health center, she frequently encountered another significant obstacle: the unavailability of essential medications. &#8220;There were times when I would finally get to the clinic only to be told that the medication I needed was not available,&#8221; Beatrice recalls. &#8220;It was very discouraging and made me feel hopeless.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" class="size-medium wp-image-8147 aligncenter" srcset="https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-300x169.jpg 300w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-768x432.jpg 768w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-2048x1153.jpg 2048w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-870x490.jpg 870w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-600x338.jpg 600w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/P1650380-480x270.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">                 <strong>  Gogo Beatrice receiving medications.</strong></span></em></p>
<p>Frustrated and worried about her health, Beatrice felt helpless until she heard about the FOCCAD outreach clinic coming to her area.</p>
<p>With the outreach clinic, FOCCAD brought healthcare directly to Beatrice’s village. On the day of the clinic, Beatrice was able to walk the short distance to the outreach site, where she received the medical attention and treatment  she desperately needed.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Foundation for Community and Capacity Development (FOCCAD) recently conducted a C3 model network orientation meeting, aimed at strengthening effective pathways for HIV case finding and management, improving service delivery, care, and support across clinic and community platforms for children, adolescents, and their families, and safeguarding sexual reproductive health rights.</p>
<p>The meeting witnessed participation from all five facilities in Thyolo and Phalombe, as well as nine facilities in Nkhotakota. The collaborative effort has resulted in a significant improvement in understanding and cooperation with Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and expert clients. This collaboration has proven effective, with most defaulters being successfully traced back to care.</p>
<p>Moreover, the orientation has led to a notable increase in knowledge about sexual and reproductive health (SRH) among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Specifically, 70% of AGYW participants reported enhanced understanding of SRH issues.</p>
<p>FOCCAD&#8217;s commitment to fostering community health and well-being through such initiatives continues to make a positive impact, as evidenced by the improved collaboration and outcomes reported by the participating facilities.</p>

<p>In the remote village of Chipale in Nkhotakota T/A Mwansambo, located in a hard-to-reach area, accessing healthcare services has long been a daunting challenge for residents. With the nearest health center situated nearly 20 kilometers away, many families faced the arduous task of traveling long distances, often on foot, to seek medical assistance. Monica, a mother of three, knows this struggle all too well.</p>
<p>Recently, when Monica&#8217;s youngest daughter fell ill with malaria, she found herself in a desperate situation. With no means of transportation and limited financial resources, she felt helpless as she watched her child suffer. However, amidst this crisis, a beacon of hope emerged in the form of FOCCAD&#8217;s Outreach Clinics.</p>
<p>These mobile healthcare units, supported by FOCCAD, bring essential medical services directly to the doorstep of communities like Mwansambo. With over 1000 people benefitting from these clinics, Monica was relieved to find help just a stone&#8217;s throw away from her home. The convenience and accessibility of the outreach services proved to be a lifeline for her family during their time of need.</p>

<p>Matilda Buwa, a 63-year-old farmer from Kakopa village in T/A Malengachanzi in Nkhotakota, faced a common challenge shared by many smallholder farmers: low crop yields due to the prohibitive cost of commercial fertilizer. However, Matilda&#8217;s determination and ingenuity led her to forge a path of success through innovation and resourcefulness, with the support of FOCCAD&#8217;s extension services.</p>
<p>Recognizing the need for an alternative to costly fertilizers, Matilda embarked on a locally available resources, she devised a simple yet effective solution: homemade manure which she was trained by FOCCAD . By blending ash, goat droppings, and maize bran with water and allowing it to decompose over three weeks, Matilda created a nutrient-rich fertilizer tailored to her crops&#8217; needs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8106" srcset="https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-300x200.jpg 300w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-768x512.jpg 768w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-500x335.jpg 500w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-870x580.jpg 870w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-600x400.jpg 600w, https://foccad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_7187-480x320.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The results were nothing short of remarkable. Matilda&#8217;s maize and rice fields flourished under the application of her homemade manure, exhibiting vigorous growth, increased productivity, and enhanced resilience to drought.</p>
<p>“<em>Instead of purchasing expensive fertilizers, I redirected my limited funds towards essential farming activities and household needs</em>” Said Matilda. This newfound freedom empowered Matilda to invest in additional food, seeds, tools, and farming items, further boosting productivity and self-sufficiency on her farm.</p>
